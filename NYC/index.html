            <dt>Cinema Chats: “The Lives of Others"</dt>
            <dd>
                In 1983 East Berlin, dedicated Stasi officer Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), doubting that a famous playwright (Sebastian Koch) is loyal to the Communist Party, receives approval to spy on the man and his actress-lover Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck). Wiesler becomes unexpectedly sympathetic to the couple, and faces conflicting loyalties when his superior takes a liking to Christa-Maria and orders Wiesler to get the playwright out of the way.

            <dd>
                The history of Whitechapel and Spitalfields between the middle of the nineteenth century to the current day is one of constant change and transformation. Associated very much with the Jewish community, the area has also been home to several other immigrant communities such as the Huguenots escaping persecution in seventeenth-century France and the Bengalis whose community grew dramatically after the Second World War.
